    // lighting.
    // This mixin solves that by synchronously storing the initial light data in the created chunk instance, where our
    // fake chunk creation code can then get it from in such cases.

    // light data when it was scheduled. However, it is not, it simply accesses the live light data from the
    // builder thread, so we need to delay unloading that, otherwise it'll render the chunk as partially black.

    // possible that our unload code runs on one frame and the vanilla load code only runs on the next one.
